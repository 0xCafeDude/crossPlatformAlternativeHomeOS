\subsection{HomeOS}
There is much research in this direction by Microsoft. HomeOS was developed by
Microsoft Research. Since the original system, Microsoft Research has continued
to use it for other research. Examples of this continued research are
HomeLab~\cite{homeLab} and Lab of Things~\cite{labOfThings}.

HomeLab is a shared infrastructure for conducting field studies for home
technology. HomeLab consists of a number of homes all containing different home
devices connected to PCs running HomeOS. A number of research groups can use
this infrastructure for conducting experiments on their device of interests.
HomeLab will allow easy sharing and co-ordination of research effort between the
different groups and will also allow them to focus on the actual experiment
rather than on the low level details of device connectivity etc. HomeLab also
allows groups to remotely update, monitor, and collect data from HomeOS.

Lab of Things consists of HomeOS and a number of cloud services. One of these
services is the Home Store from which a user can download drivers for different
devices.
