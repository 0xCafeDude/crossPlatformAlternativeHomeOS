\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Our alternative to HomeOS continues the work started by HomeOS by providing         
cross-platform support while still providing a PC-like abstraction for home         
automation devices. Our alternative is written in Java and uses open source         
software to try to maximize cross-platform capabilities. We have implemented the 
core system, but more work is needed to provide all of the same capabilities as  
HomeOS.
