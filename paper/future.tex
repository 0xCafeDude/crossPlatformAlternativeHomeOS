\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:future}
Our alternative to HomeOS continues the work started by HomeOS by providing
cross platform support while still providing a PC-like abstraction for home
automation devices. Our alternative is written in Java and uses open source
software to try to maximize cross platform capabilities. We have implemented the
core system, but more work is needed to provide all of the same capabilities as
HomeOS.

Future work includes adding additional functionality and continuing to expand
the API available to users and developers as well as making extending the system
easier. We plan to improve and expand the access control mechanisms and improve
the user interface to improve both the usability and security of the system.
Lastly, we wish to add features such as an online marketplace to allow users to
easily find applications and drivers to extend and improve their systems.
