\title{Cross platform alternative to Home OS}
\author{Christopher Becker, Shivam Kumar Sharma}

\maketitle

\section{Problem Definition & Motivation}
Our main goal is to create a cross-platform alternative of Home OS~\cite{homeOS}. Home OS is a PC like abstraction for all the networked devices at home. It presents network devices as peripherals with abstract interfaces, enables cross-device tasks via applications written against these interfaces, and gives users a management interface designed for the home environment. The management interface includes an improved access control. Home OS runs only on windows. We hope to create an alternative that is platform independent and in the process of doing so do somethings differently particularly the access control module or create something new all together.

\section{Why we chose this topic}
We both are interested in working on the internet of things and we also want to do something that is programming heavy and has some tangible outcomes. Creating a cross platform alternative to Home OS fulfills our above mentioned criterias. One of the major contributions of HomeOS is it's access control module and since we both are interested in security it was an added bonus for us.

\section{Division of Work}
We will be working closely on most of the tasks. As of now we don't have a very clear picture of all that needs to be done. Once we have that we will divide the work accordingly.

\section{Approach}
Our short term goals are to read more about Home OS, understand the existing code and create a system architecture of the alternative that we are going to develop. Once we have created the system architecture we will start writing the code. We plan to write interfaces for two different devices initially. One of the devices will be one that requires minimal access control for e.g. lights and the other device will be something that has high requirements for access control for e.g. door locks.

\section{Evaluation}
Our evaluation will mostly involve experimentation. We will check if the code works and if it does we will check whether it runs on all the major platforms.

\section{Obstacles}
The biggest hurdle that we will face is will be in interfacing with various protocol stacks and device drivers. We wil try to interface with just one simple device if that happens. We might face issues in running the code on different platforms. If that happens we will write code only for Ubuntu 14.04.

\section{Related Work}
There is a lot of microsoft research going on in this direction. They have named the research as the ``\href{http://www.lab-of-things.com/}{Lab of Things}''. The Lab of Things consists of the Home OS and a number of cloud services, one of them is the Homestore from where a user can download drivers for different devices. As of now we are creating a replica/alternative of the Home OS. We hope that we that as we go along developing our replica our approach will start deviating from that of Home OS.
