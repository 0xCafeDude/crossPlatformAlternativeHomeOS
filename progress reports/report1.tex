\section*{Progress}
Since then last checkin we have done the following:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Ordered and received a USB Z-Wave transceiver and a Z-Wave color-changing LED light bulb.
 \item Read more on the topic.
 \item Explored the HomeOS code.
 \item Installed Z-Wave transceiver drivers. We faced obstacles while building and installing the drivers as they were incompatible with our kernel versions. We were initially modifying the existing drivers to work with our operating systems, but after some searching we were able to find a driver that had been modified to run with our kernel versions.
 \item Purchased a lamp that the light bulb can be used in.
\end{enumerate}
On almost everything we worked together as much as possible.

We were not able to achieve the goal that we had initially planned to accomplish by this time.

For the upcoming week our main goal is to start coding the system and have the initial architecture ready. We should be able to develop a simple program that can at least communicate with the light bulb.
