These are the list of goals that we have thought of as of now.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Create a system architecture.
 \item Develop device drivers for the devices that we have access to.
 \item Develop the access control module.
 \item Develop the user interface.
 \item Test.
 \item If testing is successful, we will try to add new devices and/or try to develop cross device features.
