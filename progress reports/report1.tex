\section*{Progress}
Since then last checkin we have done the following. On almost everything we worked together as far as possible.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Ordered a usb z-wave transceiver and a z-wave light bulb.
 \item Read more on the topic.
 \item Explored the home os code.
 \item Installed z-wave transceiver drivers. We faced obstacles while installing the drivers as they were incompatible with kernel version greater than 3.4. Both of our kernel versions were 3.13. After some googling we were able to find a driver that had been modified to run on kernel versions greater than 3.4.
\end{enumerate}
We were not able to acheive the goal that we had initially planned to by this time.
For the upcoming week our main goal is to start coding the system. We should be able to develop atleast a simple program that can turn communicate with the light bulb.
