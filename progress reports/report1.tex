\section*{Progress}
Since then last checkin we have done the following. On almost everything we worked together as far as possible.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Ordered a usb z-wave transceiver and a z-wave light bulb.
 \item Read more on the topic.
 \item Explored the home os code.
 \item Installed z-wave transceiver drivers. We faced obstacles while installing the drivers as they were incompatible with our kernel versions. We were initially modifying the existing drivers to work with our but after some googling we were able to find a driver that had been modified to run on our kernel versions.
\end{enumerate}
We were not able to acheive the goal that we had initially planned to accomplish by this time.
For the upcoming week our main goal is to start coding the system and have the initial architecture ready. We should be able to develop a simple program that can atleast communicate with the light bulb.
