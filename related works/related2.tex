\begin{description}
 \item[Title:] A User Study of Policy Creation in a Flexible Access-Control System
 \item[Authors:] Lujo Bauer, Lorrie Faith Cranor, Robert W. Reeder, Michael K. Reiter, and Kami Vaniea
 \item[Venue/Source:] CHI

 \item[Summary:] Examines the usage of distributed access control system named Grey.  The authors conducted a study in which multiple users used Grey in a campus environment for access control over various doors.  The authors then examined the access policies used and the difference between physical key-based access control and Grey.  The authors also looked at the policies in terms of ideal policies and the real policies that can be accomplished using physical keys and Grey.
 \item[Similarities:] Trying to determine how to have access control policies capabilities meet ideal policies as much as possible.
 \item[Differences:] A distributed system that focuses on door access.
